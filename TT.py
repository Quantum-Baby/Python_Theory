INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON:
 (Easy to learn - Python Tutorial (w3schools.com); Python Tutorials: Learn Python Step-by-Step (tutorialsteacher.com); Python Overview | CodeWithHarry; Python Input and Output Statements (chercher.tech); The Good way to structure a Python Project | by Najma Bader | Towards Data Science) 
-  History :
Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. 
(Python is a high-level dynamic interpreter and autonomous open-source programming language. It is generally both object-oriented as well as general-purpose programming.)
It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. 
It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! 

Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode. However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.

Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible, though now-unsupported, Python 2.6 and 2.7.

- Structure of a Python Program :  Note - This topic is a bigger scope not possible to discuss here plz refer((76) Class 11 Informatics Practices Chapter 3|Python Program Structure-Brief Overview of Python(Code 065) - YouTube; (76) How to Structure Programming Projects for Beginners | Python Long-term Project Structuring - YouTube) 

In General Python Program Consists of so many text files, which contains python statements. Program is designed as single main, high file with one or more supplement files 
In python high level file has Important path of control of your Program the file, you can start your application. The library tools are also know as Module files. These tools are implemented for making collection of  top-level files. High level files use tools which are defined in Module files. And module files will Implement files which are Defined in other Modules. Coming to our point in python a file takes a module to get access to the tools it defines. And the tools made by a module type. The final thing is we take Modules and access attributes to their tools. In like manner this shows Programming structure of Python


- Identifiers and Keywords words : 

There are two types of words in the python programming language. One type of words has predefined meaning to the python interpreter, which are called Keywords or reserved words, and another type of words, which doesn’t have any meaning to python interpreter called Identifiers. 
Keywords in python:
Keywords have predefined meaning to the python, The words like print, if, while, for,.. etc. are keywords and if the python interpreter sees the print function, it knows that it needs to print the user-provided data on the output console.
>>> print("Hello World");
Here python will print Hello World to the output console.
We have 35 keywords in the python programming language. Here is the list of all keywords.

Program to get the list of all keywords:
Program to get list of keywords

$
Identifiers in Python
Identifiers don't have any meaning to the python interpreter, All the variable names, python function names, class names and all other names defined by programmers fall under identifiers.
As Identifiers are unknown to the python interpreter, If we create any identifier we need to define its meaning to the interpreter. For example, if we create a variable ( number = 31) , python interpreter will now know that number is an integer number and holds the value 31.

Things to Note:
Keywords have predefined meaning to the compiler
Identifiers are unknown to python, and we need to define their meaning to the compiler.
We can’t use python predefined keywords for naming our Identifiers i.e variables names, function names, and class names, etc.
Checking if the given word is keyword or not
If you don’t know the given word is keyword or not. You can check it using the iskeyword()function of the keyword module. keyword module comes in-built with the python programming language standard library.

To use the iskeyword function, First we need to import the keyword module and then pass the word in the question to the keyword.iskeyword function as an argument like below.

If the provided word is the keyword, then the iskeyword function will return True, otherwise, it returns False. (Remember True and False also keywords in the python)

Please have a look at the following IDLE code snippet.

Checking if Identifier is keyword ?

>>> import keyword            
>>>
>>> keyword.iskeyword('if')
True
>>>
>>> keyword.iskeyword('class')
True
>>>
>>> keyword.iskeyword('number')
False
>>>
>>> keyword.iskeyword('Joey')
False
>>>
>>>
As you can see from the above interactive shell output, as if is existing keyword of the python, The iskeyword function returned True. similarly for the class also iskeyword function returned True. The class keyword is used to create python classes.

But the Identifier Joey is not a keyword of python, So iskeyword returned the False. So we can use Joey as our variable name or identifier, etc.



- Concept Of Variable : 

Variables are identifiers of a physical memory location, which is used to hold values temporarily during program execution.
Python interpreter allocates memory based on the values data type of variable, different data types like integers, decimals, characters, etc. can be stored in these variables.

Python Variable Declaration
In Python, like many other programming languages, there is no need to define variables in advance. As soon as a value is assigned to a variable, it is automatically declared. This is why Python is called a dynamically typed language.

The syntax for creating variables in Python is given below:

Syntax:

<variable-name> = <value>


Assigning Values to Variables 

Python interpreter can determine what type of data is stored, so before assigning a value, variables do not need to be declared.

Usually, in all programming languages, equal sign = is used to assign values to a variable. It assigns the values of the right side operand to the left side operand.

The left side operand of = operator is the name of a variable, and the right side operand is value.

Example:

name = "Packing box" # A string
height = 10 # An integer assignment
width = 20.5 # A floating point

print (name)
print (height)
print (width)
Output:

Packing box
10 
20.5
In the above code snippet, the variable name 'height' is storing a value 10, and since the value is of type integer, the variable is automatically assigned the type integer.
Another variable name 'width' is assigned with floating type value. Then both the values are printed or displayed using the 'print' statement.

Commons Rules for Naming Variables in Python
Python has some variable related rules that must be followed:

Variable names are case-sensitive.
Variable names must begin with a letter or underscore.
A variable name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscore, such as (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _ ).
A variable name can not contents space.
Reserved words cannot be used as a variable name.
Python Variable Deletion
Python also provides the facility to delete a variable from memory. For this, the del command is used. The following is the general syntax for deleting a variable in Python:

Syntax:

del <variable-name>


- Memory Allocation for Variables : 

Q. When memory is allocated to the variable?
As in the below example different type of data is allocated to same variable

var = 10
print var
print type(var) #<type 'int'>

var = 10.5
print var
print type(var) #<type 'float'>

var = "python"
print var
print type(var) #<type 'str'>

The memory for the variable is allocated when the variable is created - e.g. when you enter the function, in case of local variables.
The memory for the object is allocated when the object is created, regardless of whether it is assigned to a variable
Python variables can easily refer to data of different types throughout their lifetime.

- Data Types in Python : 
Data type specifies the type of value a variable requires to do various operations without causing an error. By default, python provides the following built-in data types:
Following built-in data types:

Numeric data: int, float, complex
int: 3, -8, 0

float: 7.349, -9.0, 0.0000001

complex: 6 + 2i

more on numeric data types in the number chapter.

 

Text data: str
str: “Hello World!!!”, “Python Programming”

 

Boolean data:
Boolean data consists of values True or False.

 

Sequenced data: list, tuple, range
list: A list is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets. Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.

Example:

list1 = [8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ["apple", "banana"]]
print(list1)
Copy
Output:

[8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ['apple', 'banana']]
Copy
 

tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses. Tuples are immutable and can not be modified after creation. 

Example:

tuple1 = (("parrot", "sparrow"), ("Lion", "Tiger"))
print(tuple1)
Copy
Output:

(('parrot', 'sparrow'), ('Lion', 'Tiger'))
Copy
 

range: returns a sequence of numbers as specified by the user. If not specified by the user then it starts from 0 by default and increments by 1.

Example:

sequence1 = range(4,14,2)
for i in sequence1:
    print(i)
Copy
Output:

4
6
8
10
12
Copy
 

Mapped data: dict
dict: a dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair. The key:value pairs are enclosed within curly brackets.

Example:

dict1 = {"name":"Sakshi", "age":20, "canVote":True}
print(dict1)
Copy
Output:

{'name': 'Sakshi', 'age': 20, 'canVote': True}
Copy
 

Binary data: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
bytes: bytes() function is used to convert objects into byte objects, or create empty bytes object of the specified size.

Example:

#Converting string to bytes
str1 = "This is a string"
arr1 = bytes(str1, 'utf-8')
print(arr1)
arr2 = bytes(str1, 'utf-16')
print(arr2)

#Creating bytes of given size
bytestr = bytes(4)
print(bytestr)
Copy
Output:

b'This is a string'
b'\xff\xfeT\x00h\x00i\x00s\x00 \x00i\x00s\x00 \x00a\x00 \x00s\x00t\x00r\x00i\x00n\x00g\x00'
b'\x00\x00\x00\x00'
Copy
 

bytearray: bytearray() function is used to convert objects into bytearray objects, or create empty bytearray object of the specified size.

Example:

#Converting string to bytes
str1 = "This is a string"
arr1 = bytearray(str1, 'utf-8')
print(arr1)
arr2 = bytearray(str1, 'utf-16')
print(arr2)

#Creating bytes of given size
bytestr = bytearray(4)
print(bytestr)
Copy
Output:

bytearray(b'This is a string')
bytearray(b'\xff\xfeT\x00h\x00i\x00s\x00 \x00i\x00s\x00 \x00a\x00 \x00s\x00t\x00r\x00i\x00n\x00g\x00')
bytearray(b'\x00\x00\x00\x00')
Copy
 

memoryview: memoryview() function returns a memory view object from a specified object.

Example:

str1 = bytes("home", "utf-8")
memoryviewstr = memoryview(str1)
print(list(memoryviewstr[0:]))
Copy
Output:

[104, 111, 109, 101]
Copy
 

Set data:
Set is an unordered collection of elements in which no element is repeated. The elements of sets are separated by a comma and contained within curly braces.

Example:

set1 = {4, -5, 8, 3, 2.9}
print(set1)
Copy
Output:

{2.9, 3, 4, 8, -5}
Copy
 

None:
None is used to define a null value. When we assign a None value to a variable, we are essentially resetting it to its original empty state which is not the same as zero, an empty string or a False value.

Example:

state = None
print(type(state))
Copy
Output:

<class 'NoneType'>
Copy
 

- Conversion Functions :
Type Conversion in Python
Python defines type conversion functions to directly convert one data type to another which is useful in day-to-day and competitive programming. 
There are two types of Type Conversion in Python:
There are two types of Type Conversion in Python:

Implicit Type Conversion
Explicit Type Conversion
Let’s discuss them in detail.

Implicit Type Conversion
In Implicit type conversion of data types in Python, the Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another without any user involvement. To get a more clear view of the topic see the below examples.

Example:

Python3



x = 10
  
print("x is of type:",type(x))
  
y = 10.6
print("y is of type:",type(y))
  
z = x + y
  
print(z)
print("z is of type:",type(z))
Output:

x is of type: <class 'int'>
y is of type: <class 'float'>
20.6
z is of type: <class 'float'>
As we can see the data type of ‘z’ got automatically changed to the “float” type while one variable x is of integer type while the other variable y is of float type. The reason for the float value not being converted into an integer instead is due to type promotion that allows performing operations by converting data into a wider-sized data type without any loss of information. This is a simple case of Implicit type conversion in python.


Explicit Type Conversion
In Explicit Type Conversion in Python, the data type is manually changed by the user as per their requirement. With explicit type conversion, there is a risk of data loss since we are forcing an expression to be changed in some specific data type.  Various forms of explicit type conversion are explained below:
 

1. int(a, base): This function converts any data type to integer. ‘Base’ specifies the base in which string is if the data type is a string.
2. float(): This function is used to convert any data type to a floating-point number. 

Python3



# Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
# using int(), float()
  
# initializing string
s = "10010"
  
# printing string converting to int base 2
c = int(s,2)
print ("After converting to integer base 2 : ", end="")
print (c)
  
# printing string converting to float
e = float(s)
print ("After converting to float : ", end="")
print (e)
Output: 

After converting to integer base 2 : 18
After converting to float : 10010.0
3. ord() : This function is used to convert a character to integer.
4. hex() : This function is to convert integer to hexadecimal string.
5. oct() : This function is to convert integer to octal string.

Python3



# Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
# using  ord(), hex(), oct()
  
# initializing integer
s = '4'
  
# printing character converting to integer
c = ord(s)
print ("After converting character to integer : ",end="")
print (c)
  
# printing integer converting to hexadecimal string
c = hex(56)
print ("After converting 56 to hexadecimal string : ",end="")
print (c)
  
# printing integer converting to octal string
c = oct(56)
print ("After converting 56 to octal string : ",end="")
print (c)
Output: 

After converting character to integer : 52
After converting 56 to hexadecimal string : 0x38
After converting 56 to octal string : 0o70
6. tuple() : This function is used to convert to a tuple.
7. set() : This function returns the type after converting to set.
8. list() : This function is used to convert any data type to a list type.

Python3



# Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
# using  tuple(), set(), list()
  
# initializing string
s = 'geeks'
  
# printing string converting to tuple
c = tuple(s)
print ("After converting string to tuple : ",end="")
print (c)
  
# printing string converting to set
c = set(s)
print ("After converting string to set : ",end="")
print (c)
  
# printing string converting to list
c = list(s)
print ("After converting string to list : ",end="")
print (c)
Output: 

After converting string to tuple : ('g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's')
After converting string to set : {'k', 'e', 's', 'g'}
After converting string to list : ['g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's']
9. dict() : This function is used to convert a tuple of order (key,value) into a dictionary.
10. str() : Used to convert integer into a string.
11. complex(real,imag) : This function converts real numbers to complex(real,imag) number.

Python3



# Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
# using  dict(), complex(), str()
  
# initializing integers
a = 1
b = 2
  
# initializing tuple
tup = (('a', 1) ,('f', 2), ('g', 3))
  
# printing integer converting to complex number
c = complex(1,2)
print ("After converting integer to complex number : ",end="")
print (c)
  
# printing integer converting to string
c = str(a)
print ("After converting integer to string : ",end="")
print (c)
  
# printing tuple converting to expression dictionary
c = dict(tup)
print ("After converting tuple to dictionary : ",end="")
print (c)
Output: 

After converting integer to complex number : (1+2j)
After converting integer to string : 1
After converting tuple to dictionary : {'a': 1, 'f': 2, 'g': 3}
12. chr(number): This function converts number to its corresponding ASCII character. 

Python3



# Convert ASCII value to characters
a = chr(76)
b = chr(77)
  
print(a)
print(b)
Output: 

L
M
- Operators (Arithmetic Operator, Relational, Logical or Boolean Operator, Assignment, Bitwise Operator Membership Operator). 
Operators are special symbols that perform some operation on operands and returns the result. For example, 5 + 6 is an expression where + is an operator that performs arithmetic add operation on numeric left operand 5 and the right side operand 6 and returns a sum of two operands as a result.

Python includes the operator module that includes underlying methods for each operator. For example, the + operator calls the operator.add(a,b) method.

Example: Operator Methods
>>> 5 + 6 
11
>>> import operator
>>> operator.add(5, 6)
11
>>> operator.__add__(5, 6)
11
Above, expression 5 + 6 is equivalent to the expression operator.add(5, 6) and operator.__add__(5, 6). Many function names are those used for special methods, without the double underscores (dunder methods). For backward compatibility, many of these have functions with the double underscores kept.

Python includes the following categories of operators:

Arithmetic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
Identity Operators
Membership Test Operators
Bitwise Operators
Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform the common mathematical operation on the numeric operands.

The arithmetic operators return the type of result depends on the type of operands, as below.

If either operand is a complex number, the result is converted to complex;
If either operand is a floating point number, the result is converted to floating point;
If both operands are integers, then the result is an integer and no conversion is needed.
The following table lists all the arithmetic operators in Python:

Operation	Operator	Function	Example in Python Shell

Logical Operators
The logical operators are used to combine two boolean expressions. The logical operations are generally applicable to all objects, and support truth tests, identity tests, and boolean operations.

Operator	Description	Example
and	True if both are true	
>>> x = 5; y = 6
>>> x > 1 and y <10
True
or	True if at least one is true	
>>> x = 5; y = 6
>>> x > 6 or y <10
True
not	Returns True if an expression evalutes to false and vice-versa	
>>> x = 5
>>> not x > 1 
False
Identity Operators
The identity operators check whether the two objects have the same id value e.i. both the objects point to the same memory location.

Operator	Function	Description	Example in Python Shell
is	operator.is_(a,b)	True if both are true	
>>> x = 5; y = 6
>>> x is y 
False
>>> import operator
>>> operator.is_(x,y)
False
is not	operator.is_not(a,b)	True if at least one is true	
>>> x = 5; y = 6
>>> x is not y
True
>>> import operator
>>> operator.is_not(x, y)
True
Membership Test Operators
The membership test operators in and not in test whether the sequence has a given item or not. For the string and bytes types, x in y is True if and only if x is a substring of y.

Operator	Function	Description	Example in Python Shell
in	operator.contains(a,b)	Returns True if the sequence contains the specified item else returns False.	
>>> nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
>>> 1 in nums 
True
>>> 10 in nums 
False
>>> 'str' in 'string'
True
>>> import operator
>>> operator.contains(nums, 2)
True
not in	not operator.contains(a,b)	Returns True if the sequence does not contains the specified item, else returns False.	
>>> nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
>>> 1 not in nums 
False
>>> 10 not in nums 
True
>>> 'str' not in 'string'
False
>>> import operator
>>> not operator.contains(nums, 2)
False
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform operations on binary operands.

Operator	Function	Description	Example in Python Shell
&	operator.and_(a,b)	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.	
>>> x=5; y=10
>>> z=x & y 
>>> z
0
>>> import operator
>>> operator.and_(x, y)
0
|	operator.or_(a,b)	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1.	
>>> x=5; y=10
>>> z=x | y 
>>> z
15
>>> import operator
>>> operator.or_(x, y)
15
^	operator.xor(a,b)	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1.	
>>> x=5; y=10
>>> z=x ^ y 
>>> z
15
>>> import operator
>>> operator.xor(x, y)
15
~	operator.invert(a)	Inverts all the bits.	
>>> x=5
>>> ~x
-6
>>> import operator
>>> operator.invert(x)
-6
<<	operator.lshift(a,b)	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off.	
>>> x=5
>>> x<<2
20
>>> import operator
>>> operator.lshift(x,2)
20
>>	operator.rshift(a,b)	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off.	
>>> x=5
>>> x>>2

- Input and Output Function. 

Input : Any information or data sent to the computer from the user through the keyboard is called input.
Output: The information produced by the computer to the user is called output.

Python provides us with the two inbuilt functions as input() and output().

The syntax for input is input(prompt_message); the python will automatically identify whether the user entered a string, number, or list; if the input entered from the user is not correct, then python will throw a syntax error.

And the syntax for the output in python is print(), normally used to print the output.

Python-2 supports the raw_input() function and input() function
Python-3 supports only for input() function .
The following example will read two inputs from the keyboard and print the sum

x=input("Enter First number:")
y=input("Enter Second Number:")
i=int(x)
j=int(y)
print("The Sum:", i+j)

Or else even we can simplify the above program:
x=int(input("Enter Fisrt number:"))
y=int(input("Enter Second Number:"))
print("The Sum:", i+j)


- Control Statements (Looping - while Loop, for LOOP, Loop Control. Conditional Statement-if...else) : 
Sometimes a programmer wants to execute a group of statements a certain number of times. This can be done using loops. Based on this loops are further classified into following types; for loop, while loop, nested loops.

Python for Loop
for Loop
for loops can iterate over a sequence of iterable objects in python. Iterating over a sequence is nothing but iterating over strings, lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries.

 

Example: iterating over a string:

name = 'Abhishek'
for i in name:
    print(i, end=", ")
Copy
Output:

A, b, h, i, s, h, e, k,
Copy
 

Example: iterating over a tuple:

colors = ("Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow")
for x in colors:
    print(x)
Copy
Output:

Red
Green
Blue
Yellow
Copy
 

Similarly, we can use loops for lists, sets and dictionaries.

 



 

What if we do not want to iterate over a sequence? What if we want to use for loop for a specific number of times?

Here, we can use the range() function.

Example:

for k in range(5):
    print(k)
Copy
Output:

0
1
2
3
4
Copy
Here, we can see that the loop starts from 0 by default and increments at each iteration.

 

But we can also loop over a specific range.

Example:

for k in range(4,9):
    print(k)
Copy
Output:

4
5
6
7
8
Copy
 

Python while Loop
As the name suggests, while loops execute statements while the condition is True. As soon as the condition becomes False, the interpreter comes out of the while loop. 



Example:

count = 5
while (count > 0):
    print(count)
    count = count - 1
Copy
Output:

5
4
3
2
1
Copy
Here, the count variable is set to 5 which decrements after each iteration. Depending upon the while loop condition, we need to either increment or decrement the counter variable (the variable count, in our case) or the loop will continue forever.

 

We can even use the else statement with the while loop. Essentially what the else statement does is that as soon as the while loop condition becomes False, the interpreter comes out of the while loop and the else statement is executed. 

Example:

x = 5
while (x > 0):
    print(x)
    x = x - 1
else:
    print('counter is 0')
Copy
Output:

5
4
3
2
1
counter is 0
Copy
 

Nested Loops
We can use loops inside other loops, such types of loops are called as nested loops.

 

Example: nesting for loop in while loop

while (i<=3):
    for k in range(1, 4):
        print(i, "*", k, "=", (i*k))
    i = i + 1
    print()
Copy
Output:

1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3

2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6

3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
Copy
 

Example: nesting while loop in for loop

for i in range(1, 4):
    k = 1
    while (k<=3):
        print(i, "*", k, "=", (i*k))
        k = k + 1
    print()
Copy
Output:

1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3

2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6

3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
Copy
 



Conditional Statement 

if Statement
Sometimes the programmer needs to check the evaluation of certain expression(s), whether the expression(s) evaluate to True or False. If the expression evaluates to False, then the program execution follows a different path then it would have if the expression had evaluated to True.

Based on this, the conditional statements are further classified into following types; if, if……else, elif, nested if.

 

if Statement:
A simple if statement works on following principle,

execute the block of code inside if statement if the expression evaluates True.
ignore the block of code inside if statement if the expression evaluates False and return to the code outside if statement.


 

Example:

applePrice = 180
budget = 200
if (applePrice <= budget):
    print("Alexa, add 1kg Apples to the cart.")
Copy
Output:

Alexa, add 1kg Apples to the cart.
Copy
 

 

if-else Statement
An if……else statement works on the following principle,

execute the block of code inside if statement if the expression evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if……else block.
execute the block of code inside else statement if the expression evaluates False. After execution return to the code out of the if……else block.
 



 

Example:

applePrice = 210
budget = 200
if (applePrice <= budget):
    print("Alexa, add 1kg Apples to the cart.")
else:
    print("Alexa, do not add Apples to the cart.")
Copy
Output:

Alexa, do not add Apples to the cart.
Copy
 

elif Statement
Sometimes, the programmer may want to evaluate more than one condition, this can be done using an elif statement.

 

An elif statement works on the following principle,

execute the block of code inside if statement if the initial expression evaluates to True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.
execute the block of code inside the first elif statement if the expression inside it evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.
execute the block of code inside the second elif statement if the expression inside it evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.
.
.
.
execute the block of code inside the nth elif statement if the expression inside it evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.
execute the block of code inside else statement if none of the expression evaluates to True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.
 



 

Example:

num = 0
if (num < 0):
    print("Number is negative.")
elif (num == 0):
    print("Number is Zero.")
else:
    print("Number is positive.")
Copy
Output:

Number is Zero.
Copy
 

Nested if Statement
We can use if, if….else, elif statements inside other if statements. 

 

Example:

num = 18
if (num < 0):
    print("Number is negative.")
elif (num > 0):
    if (num <= 10):
        print("Number is between 1-10")
    elif (num > 10 and num <= 20):
        print("Number is between 11-20")
    else:
        print("Number is greater than 20")
else:
    print("Number is zero")
Copy
Output:

Number is between 11-20
Copy
 

 




- Difference between break, continue and pass.
Break, Continue, and Pass Statements in Python are also known as jump statements because they are often used with for and while loop to skip a part of a loop or exit out of the loop.
Python Break Statement
Break statement in python is used to exit from the loop when a certain condition is satisfied.

It is often used to terminate the execution or iteration of ‘for’ or ‘while’ loop.

Here is an example in python which uses a break statement.

Recommended: Python range()

x = 0
for x in range(10):
    if x == 4:
        break
    print(x)
output

0
1
2
3

In the above python program, we first initialized x=0 then we constructed a ‘for statement‘ to output all numbers from 0 to 9.

Inside the for loop, there is also a break statement with condition x==4. This means the loop will terminate when x value gets equal to 4.

In the output, we got what we expected i.e. the execution of the loop stops at 4 and as a result, we didn’t get any number greater than or equal to 4 in the output.

Python Continue Statement
Continue statement in python is used to skip the part of a ‘for’ or ‘while’ loop whenever a condition gets satisfied.

We usually use it when we don’t want to terminate the loop but skip some iterations in between depending on some conditions.

Let’s see an python example of a continue statement for better intuition.

x = 0
for x in range(10):
    if x == 4:
        continue
    print(x)
output

0
1
2
3
5
6
7
8
9

In the above program, we have written a ‘for loop’ to print all numbers from 0 to 9.

But within the loop, there is also an if statement with condition x==4 along with continue.

This means when x is 4 the continue statement forces the loop to go for its next iteration rather than executing the statements which follows (i.e print(x)).

That is why we didn’t get 4 in the output.

The difference between Python break and continue is that the break statement stops the execution of the loop whereas continue does not.


Python Pass Statement
Pass statement in python is used as a placeholder for implementations inside functions, loops, etc.

Let’s see an example using a pass statement.

x = 0
for x in range(10):
    if x == 4:
        pass
    print(x)
output

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9


Notice the output is as there is no conditional statement in the program. In short, pass didn’t have any effect on the program end result.

We use pass statement inside the loop as a placeholder for future implementations. Use it when you don’t have any statement as of now to write inside if statement but is sure that in the future you will surely have the implementation.



Summery on Control Statement which are using for control Loops

Control Statements
There are three control statements that can be used with for and while loops to alter their behaviour.

They are pass, continue and break.

 

1. pass:
Whenever loops, functions, if statements, classes, etc are created, it is needed that we should write a block of code in it. An empty code inside loop, if statement or function will give an error. 

Example:

i = 1
while (i<5):
Copy
Output:

IndentationError: expected an indented block
Copy
 

To avoid such an error and to continue the code execution, pass statement is used. pass statement acts as a placeholder for future code.

Example:

i = 1
while (i<5):
    pass

for j in range(5):
    pass

if (i == 2):
    pass
Copy
The above code does not give an error.

 

2. continue:
This keyword is used in loops to end the current iteration and continue the next iteration of the loop. Sometimes within a loop, we might need to skip a specific iteration. This can be done using the continue keyword.

Example 1:

for i in range(1,10):
    if(i%2 == 0):
        continue   
    print(i)
Copy
Output:

1
3
5
7
9
Copy
 

Example 2:

i = 1
while (i <= 10):
    i = i + 1
    if (i%2 != 0):
        continue
    print(i)
Copy
Output:

2
4
6
8
10
Copy
 

3. break:
The break keyword is used to bring the interpreter out of the loop and into the main body of the program. Whenever the break keyword is used, the loop is terminated and the interpreter starts executing the next series of statements within the main program.

Example 1:

i = 1
while (i <= 10):
    i = i + 1
    if (i == 5):
        break
    print(i)
Copy
Output:

2
3
4
Copy
 

Example 2:

for i in range(1, 10):
    print(i)
    if (i == 5):
        break
Copy
Output:

1
2
3
4
5
Copy
